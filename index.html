        <h1>I have a dark side, too.</h1>
        <p>I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I
            could see. God created pudding, and then he rested. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a
            compliment.</p>
        <p>I'm partial to air conditioning. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my
            sister. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely.
            <strong> With my own set of rules.</strong> <em> I'm Dexter.</em> Boo.
        </p>
